This MQTT based weather and envriornmental project is strcutred around gathering, sending and visulising real-time simulated data. from the Publisher to the subscriber it ensures effeicient data exchange
and provides key information such as temperature,CO2 levels and humidity. THis supports real-world application such as disaster preparedness and public health relations. This project is set up in a systematical way 
which you are able to add new features into it seamlessly.

To run the code you will have to run PublisherV1.py then SubscriberV1.py then Visulisation.py to get it working if you would like to see the table of data you can also run the table.py after the Visulisation.py
The Map test.py and Map generate.py are codes that i  had used to experiment with on generating the map and its markers.
